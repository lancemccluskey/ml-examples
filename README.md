# ML-Examples

Machine learning examples built using tensorflow.js. All of the examples use the same `cars` dataset.

## Linear Regression

This model uses the features `horsepower`, `displacement`, and `weight` of a car to predict the `mpg`.

## K-Nearest Neighbors

This model uses the features `horsepower`, `displacement`, and `weight` of a car to predict the `mpg`.

## Logistic Regression

This model uses the features `horsepower`, `displacement`, `weight`, and `mpg` of a car to predict if it passed emissions.
